/*
 We are looking to capture PB charges in this request.  The ASAP LOS Charges report is used for Kentucky ED physicians and Lima Urgent Care.  
 We would like this to run automatically the 1st of each month for two months prior.  Example November 1st, September would run.  
 In truth we only want to see services without a level of service, but this report pulls everything and I filter.
